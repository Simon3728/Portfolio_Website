        <p class="mt-5">
            The goal of this project was to showcase my data visualization skills using Looker Studio. I utilized data from an 
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervemenekse/ecommerce-dataset" target="_blank" class="text-reset">E-Commerce dataset</a> to create a 
            comprehensive yearly overview for an E-Commerce platform. The report provides insights into various key metrics, including sales, shipping, 
            customer demographics, and other valuable information from the past year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is the interactive report I created.

        <h2 class="mt-3">Graph Creation</h2>
        <p>
            The data source for city information is <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities" target="_blank" class="text-reset">Simple Maps</a>. 
            This data includes population and coordinates, which are necessary for calculating the distances between cities. 
            The coordinates allow us to use the Haversine distance formula, which determines the shortest distance between two points 
            on the Earth's surface, taking into account the Earth's curvature. The Haversine distance is used for both of the solvers.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the city data, a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is created, which ensures that there is a path connecting all nodes. 
            To add complexity to the graph, additional connections are made. You can select a desired degree (the number of connections a node has), 
            and new connections to the nearest unconnected nodes will be created until the desired degree is achieved. 
            This approach allows for comparing the solvers under different graph complexities. The graph is represented through an adjacency list for efficient navigation.
